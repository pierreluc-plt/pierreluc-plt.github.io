I am an Engineering Physics PhD student (2021- now) in the Light-Matter group at Polytechnique Montréal. Prior to entering the PhD program, I completed a Bachelor of Engineering Physics at Polytechnique Montréal. 

My research is at the intersection of nonlinear optics, integrated photonics and nanomaterials. In other words, I explore the use of thin films of "novel materials" to enable efficient nonlinear optical processes on integrated photonic chips. My daily tasks involve the fabrication of thin films, characterization of their linear and nonlinear optical properties and the  design (and testing)  of photonics devices.  

Outside of my studies, I enjoy hiking, road (and gravel) cycling and reading. Before focusing on my studies, I used to play professional table tennis. I represented Canada in several international events and won the North American championship in 2012.
