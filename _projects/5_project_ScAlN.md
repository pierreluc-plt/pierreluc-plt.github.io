In this project, we aim to characterize the  second-order nonlinear optical properties of epitaxially-grown scandium-doped aluminum nitride (ScAlN) thin films. ScAlN has gained attention due to its enhanced piezoelectric and ferroelectric response, making it a promising material for integrated photonics and optoelectronics. The nonlinear optical response is also enhanced compared to "pure" aluminium nitride. We are  characterizing the second-order nonlinear response of these thin films as a function of scandium concentration and other growth parameters. 

This project is in collaboration with the University of Michigan @ Ann Arbor.
