I will be presenting the preliminary results for this project at FiO 2025 at the end of October: 

Fundamental-Mode Phase-Matching for Nonlinear Optics in Spontaneously-Oriented Organic Films Waveguides (FW1B.3)

*Abstract:*
We demonstrate efficient second-order nonlinear interactions in strip-loaded waveguides using spontaneously-oriented organic films. Their large anisotropy enables fundamental-mode phase-matching, which provides an inherently large modal overlap, overcoming a key challenge in integrated photonics.
